CirQit 2.0 with:
 - Added universal reduction after each resolution step.
   This prevents occasional problem where the reducible literals
   prevent the unit implicant from being recognized.
     (then the unit implicant is resolved upon. If it happens to
       be a decision literal, this causes an assertion fault).
   This is only relevant for Don't Care variables
- Don't cares are now in both trees at the same time
  (+some details to prevent unneeded propagation)
- Added larify() - break down nodes by quantifier level,
   to achieve better utilization of universal reduction
   (for eg, in planning infer that all action uniqueness 
    axioms have to hold rather just for a particular action.
    This couldn't be done before because we needed to reduce 
    the universal variables)
    
- Larify is now controlled by input parameter
- Added number of backtracks to output stats

- Added remembering phases


- Added qpro input format


started on caching negations (not done.. just some junk code)

- UndoRecord is now a single class
- Undoing no longer creates and deletes

- Added sorting children by block
    (... in descending order!)

- UPstack is now done locally, without new and delete

- Added framework for initial preprocessing on the tree (DummyTreeNode)

- Added simplification on the leafs (rules like (a^f(a) == a^f(false)))

CirQit2.0.7.3
- Started simplification on formulas
   - added nameFunction which finds the same formulas, and their negations
   - modified checkDown to also process children
   2.0.7.3.1:
   - added merging negations in makeCircuit

CirQit2.1
- Changed i/o format to suit the competition

CirQit2.1b
- Fixed small errors: 
<    assignments.del(children[i]->thisFunc, true);
>    assignments.del(children[j]->thisFunc, true);
- Fixed (string) error messages so they'll display properly


CirQit3.1.1
- Adding proof tracing
  -> option -proof
  -> got rid of reason stack
  -> new format for Reason and matching functions in NotGate, AndOrGate and LearnedSet.

cirQit3.1.2
- Outputs the proof.
  -> added reason for "output" at newDecisionLevel
  -> added getEmpty() to explicitely derive the empty clause

cirQit3.1.3
- Fixing the sorting function

cirQit3.1.4
- Fixing the segmentation fault error with solved by preprocessing
- Modified include files - on some systems memset was not found
