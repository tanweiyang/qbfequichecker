# QBFEquiChecker

This is a software component used to verify if the unknown netlist exhibits 
behaviours of a known netlist as described in the paper "Reverse Engineering 
Digital Circuits Using Structural and Functional Analyses (2014)".


# Warning

This is currently unmaintained. Some of the unit test cases will not work due 
to last minute changes in code.

Also, as this piece of code was implemented in a rather hastily manner, the
modelling of the netlist is not very well done.

Perhaps in the future, I may release a much improved version of this tool.
